<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p> My name is Austin Kind and I am from Homer Glen, IL. I live with my mom, dad, and brother. 
I have two dogs, named Roxy and Teddy. I enjoy hanging out with my friends, listening to 
music, and watching sports. I currently have a job as a baseball umpire, and as a math tutor for younger kids. 
I am a freshman at Lewis majoring in computer science. My dad got me into computers when I was a kid, so I 
decided that I wanted to do more with computers in the future.</p>
<h2><b>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</b></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li> 
<li>Networks</li>
<li>The World Wide Web</li>
<li>Computer Security</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>My Favorite Hobby</b></h2>
<p>My favorite hobby is listening to music. I listen to music everyday. I listen to music when I wake up, while I 
get ready for school, while I do my homework, while I eat, while I drive, and right before I go to sleep. My 
favorite genre of music is rock. I like 80s and 90s rock, as well as contemporary rock. My favorite rock bands 
include Coldplay, The Wallows, Blink-182, The Neighbourhood, Young the Giant, Of Monsters and Men, and The 
Strokes. I would listen to music 24/7, if that were possible.</p>
<p>For as much as I love music, I have not actually been to too many concerts. My first concert was a Coldplay 
concert that I went to back in 2016 with my dad. I had never been to a concert before so it was a really 
awesome and enjoyable experience for me. A few years later, me and my friend Colton went to an Ozzy Osbourne 
concert. That concert was a lot more wild than the Coldplay concert, but I still had an amazing time. Another 
concert I went to was to see Of Monsters And Men. I saw them just last year. Their show was phenomenal and was 
definitely my favorite concert yet. I hope that concerts can start happening again soon so that I can hear 
some more of my favorite bands in person!</p>

<h2><b>Fun Fact</b></h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I lived in Norway for about two years when I was younger. My dad was in the military
when I was a kid and he was stationed out in Oslo. Therefore, my mom and I moved out to Oslo as soon as I was 
born. I lived there until I was almost two before we came back to Illinois.</p>
